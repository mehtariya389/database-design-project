# COVID-19 Vaccination Database Design Project

This repository contains the files for my database design project focused on COVID-19 vaccination data. The project uses data from Our World in Data's (OWID) COVID-19 dataset.

## Data Source

The vaccination data used in this project comes from the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset:
